# Etch-a-Sketch is a small drawing project to practice my DOM manipulation skills and JS in general. (Based on The Odin Project).

###### I used 'flex-box' method instead of 'grid' to achieve grid with different hovering options and CSS styling. ######

###### Throughout the exercise i implemented a 'Rainbow' button that generates a random color for each hovered grid cell, ###### 
###### 'Default color' button for someone who wants to get back to the default color, ######
###### 'Eraser' button in order to be able to erase the drawing, ######
###### 'Color picker' which enables to pick any color for drawing, ######
###### 'Slider' that enables to change the size of the grid (from 1x1 to 100x100), ######
###### and a 'Reset the grid' button, which delets the drawing completely! ######

###### In order to draw on Etch-a-Sketch you have to press down and hold the mouse to draw on the grid rather than just hover. Something that was the most challenging for me to do, because i tried to do something that wasn't quite comfortable with yet. ######

###### The Odin Project gave me lots of challenges in order to try my best to complete this small project, but in general it was fun. ######
###### I learned many small things that haven't been taught by TOP yet, such as media queries for responsiveness (still lots to learn), some unique CSS stylings, slider event listener, etc. ######

###### Overall this helped me to get to learn more about JS and CSS, but also become more familiar with problem solving. ######
